        "aboutPerson": "Just over 10 weeks ago I was 40 weeks pregnant with my second child and weighing in at 14 and a half stone. Throughout my pregnancy I was told I was having a huge baby which I felt warranted my enormous weight gain. (Of course, it had to be the baby.) However; on 22nd November I delivered a very average sized baby weighing 7lbs 9oz and therefore had absolutely no excuse for the colossal gain I'd made; other than the bad food choices I'd made whilst pregnant. Obviously retained and amniotic fluid, increased blood and fat storage for pregnancy all played a part in my weight but 6 weeks postpartum I felt I had no more excuses left. I was the biggest I've ever been and it was now down to me to do something about it. I had no energy, low mood and felt really rubbish about myself. I went to my friends baby shower and saw photos of myself and literally couldn't believe it was me!! I started The 90 day SAS straight away and 4 weeks later I'm 16lbs lighter and 18 inches smaller!!!! IN FOUR WEEKS! Not only this but I have so much more energy, I feel refreshed and so much more comfortable in my skin. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a long way off where I want to be and have lumps and bumps in places I'm not so keen on, but I'm now so excited for what the next four weeks will bring. I've always been someone who enjoyed fitness but for the last two years I've neglected my body. 100% of my time is dedicated to my children through the day and my evenings are spent working on my business. Time for me is practically non-existent but with a calculated nutritional switch and 5x 25 minute HIIT home workouts a week I've managed to find myself again. I made a conscious decision for me, and I'm so bloody glad I did! Bring on cycle 2 &#128170;&#127996;"

        "aboutPerson": "After a typically boozy and food heavy Christmas 2018, it was time for something new and the Body Coach plan had been on my radar for quite some time and I'd run out of excuses!!! What really captured my mind, was the simplicity of exercising for 25 mins a day, 4-5 days a week whilst following an eating plan that doesn't feel diet like #TheDream. All meals made so far by my massively supportive wife have all turned out well, and are very tasty (particular simple fav is steak and egg's).Topping up any end of day hunger pangs with a protein shake has been a god send, instead of reaching for the chocolate biscuits and I think this would be a great help for anyone.I'd say in cycle one, that I've followed the diet 90-95% of the time with the odd slip (ketchups, sauces, shared chinese) but nothing like my previous and daily misdemeanours! The 5 exercise routines set out for C1 have been challenging, and as you can push yourself as much or as little as you like it has worked well for me.In my household we have affectionately renamed my daily routine (myself, wife and kids) as 'Joe Wicks in your Knicks'.........this is because I do the routine every morning at 6am in obvious attire!!!! No point overdressing when your planning on sweating! ;o) And I must say each routine provides adequate opportunity to work a good old sweat, which at the time I show NO sign of enjoying but the arrival of all those endorphins afterwards makes it ALL worthwhile.I'm now looking forward to C2 with the addition of some weighted exercises, AND new meal options to keep my interest for the next 4 weeks - Bring it on! Finally, I'd like to say this plan would really suit anybody who is willing to follow the meal and exercise plans....and for sure those results will follow. All in all I'm really pleased that I personally chose the 90 day Body Coach plan, and I'd be happy to endorse the guidance, and support provided during every step (or lunge, or bear crawl, or even burpee!!)."

        "aboutPerson": "After finishing Cycle 1 I've lost weight and I've lost inches, but what I have found the most beneficial are things that cannot really be measured. I've made such a lifestyle change, I look forward to exercising, my fitness levels have dramatically increased, I have more energy, I sleep better, my eating habits are so much better and my overall mood has improved.I would recommend this plan to everyone, it's not just a weight loss programme, it really is so much more."
